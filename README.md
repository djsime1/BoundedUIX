Bounded UIX
===========

A [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) mod for [Resonite](https://resonite.com/) that makes UIX elements selectable and editable with the usual Slot gizmos,
as well as fixing UIX elements breaking when a parent is inserted.

Selection, Gizmo and Slot creation behavior, as well as the names of newly inserted slots can be modified in the settings.  
Using the Create Pivot at Center button on Slots will create a parent with a point-anchor and symmetrical offsets to achieve the size.

## Installation
1. Install [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader).
2. Place [BoundedUIX.dll](https://github.com/djsime1/BoundedUIX/releases/latest/download/BoundedUIX.dll) into your `rml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Resonite\rml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with ResoniteModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
3. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Resonite logs.
